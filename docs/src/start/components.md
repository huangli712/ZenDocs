# Components

Well, the DFT + DMFT calculation is extremely complicated. It is almost impossible to finish the whole task within a single program. So, just like the other DFT + DMFT codes, such as eDMFT and TRIQS, the Zen computation framework is also composed of a few components. They are listed as follows:

* Core framework
    * **ZenCore** (v0.8.4-devel.250326)
* Auxiliary tools
    * **ZenGui** (v0.3.0-devel.250401)
    * **ZenTools** (v0.1.0-devel.250327)
* Documentation
    * **ZenDocs** (v0.1.2-devel.250402)
* Tests and tutorials
    * **ZenTests** (v0.2.0-devel.250402)
* Dynamical mean-field theory codes
    * **Dyson** (v0.7.5-devel.250326)
    * **DFermion** (v0.0.4-devel.230628)
* Quantum impurity solvers
    * **iQIST** (v0.8.2-devel.230706)
* Analytic continuation tools
    * **ACFlow** (v2.1.2-devel.250321)
    * **ACGui** (v0.7.0-devel.250324)
    * **ACTest** (v1.1.1-devel.250121)
* Numerical library
    * **Flink** (v1.2.0-devel.20250116)
